        At <strong>OLIGHT JEWELRY</strong>, we believe that every piece tells a story — a story of light, love, 
        and timeless beauty. What began in 2010 as a small atelier driven by passion and craftsmanship has grown 
        into a celebration of artistry and authenticity. 
      </p>

      <p className="story-text">
        Each creation is meticulously handcrafted to reflect individuality and emotion, 
        blending contemporary elegance with classic refinement. From the first sketch to the final polish, 
        we honor the art of jewelry-making — transforming raw materials into expressions of confidence, 
        connection, and grace.
      </p>

      <p className="story-text">
        At OLIGHT, we don’t just design jewelry — we illuminate the essence of who you are.  
        Every sparkle captures a moment, every piece carries a memory, and every collection 
        is a tribute to the beauty that shines from within.
